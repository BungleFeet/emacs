	* admin/org-synch.el (org-synch): Take a package filename
	parameter instead of guessing the package name.  Extract the date
	as a fixed substring and do sanity checking on it.

	* admin/org-synch.sh: Use PATH instead of explicit executables.
	Qualify $pkgname consistently.  Run org-synch.el with --eval to
	pass $pkgname directly.

	* admin/package-update.sh: Disable org-mode fetch by default.  Add
	option ($2 set to anything) to run fetchers anyway.  Use PATH
	instead of explicit executables.  Create tarballs from the
	unpackages packages in $PACKAGE_TARBALLS.
